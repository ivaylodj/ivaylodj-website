# Launch Audit & Plan — ivaylodj.com

**Goal:** best-in-class, polished fine-art photography site that ranks as highly as possible in **search engines and AI/answer engines** for "ivaylodj", "Ivaylo Djounov", "fine art photography Varna/Bulgaria", "nightscape/astrophotography Bulgaria", and the site's hot topics — for the real-domain go-live on **2026-07-26** (postponed +48h from 07-24; `csoon_ivaylodj` countdown now ends 2026-07-26 23:59:59).

**Source:** two deep audits (content/photography+design; SEO/AEO) run 2026-07-19/20. This doc = the actionable, phased plan + record. Resume from the first unchecked item.

**Legend:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (committed) · `[!]` needs user input

---

## ✅ PHASE 1 — Launch-blockers + SEO quick wins — DONE (commit `7630387`)
- [x] **Vera Su** reframed Portrait/Fashion → Black Sea shipwreck (title/meta/OG/Twitter/JSON-LD/genre; slide titles: Run Aground / Against the Coast / Held Fast / Salvage). *User approved facts.*
- [x] Funfair `%20` decoded in title/og/twitter/JSON-LD name (image-path `%20` correctly kept).
- [x] Removed phantom "portraits" (portfolio index meta/OG/Twitter/JSON-LD; seasons/autumn meta+genre→Nature; seasons tile → "nature, seasons").
- [x] contacts.html mobile menu: demo twitter/pinterest/bare social links → real FB + IG.
- [x] Voice unified "hobby/amateur" → "fine art photographer" (contacts.html, blog.html, welcome-post.md).
- [x] `sameAs` populated (FB + IG) in Person JSON-LD (index.html, about.html) — key entity/AEO signal.
- [x] **Favicon set** generated from `img/logo.png` (white emblem composited on `#171717`): `favicon.ico` (16/32/48) + `favicon-16/32`, `apple-touch-icon` (180), `android-chrome-192/512`, `site.webmanifest`, `theme-color`. Wired into all 27 pages (absolute `/` paths). *Pillow installed user-level to build these.*
- [x] Canonicals: 4 subdir index pages normalized to trailing-slash (canonical + og:url + JSON-LD url).
- [x] robots.txt blocks `/static/admin/`; sitemap `changefreq` weekly→monthly (22), lastmod bumped.
- [x] Stripped demo/fashion captions: birds (7), sunsets (30 incl. 18× "Sunset", 8× "Road to Home").
- [x] **Also merged in this commit (was "Part A" polish):** theme.js hygiene (28 setTimeout string-eval → function refs; removed dead `.nested-toggle` handler); sticky-header `stick_me` threshold 1024→1199 (match `position:fixed @media(min-width:1200px)`, kills 1025–1199px logo-shrink quirk — **deliberate Aurel deviation, user-approved**); **header part-width feedback-loop fix** (menu drifting right / vanishing on repeated resize — was a pre-existing Aurel bug in `cherga_theme_setup`); reconciled IMAGE_CLEANUP.md.

Prior related commit: `2b9b6b2` (Golden Hour cover de-dup, about.html hero type+CTA fix, about footer featured widget, namibia pre-footer removal).

---

## ✅ PHASE 2 — SEO structure — DONE (commits `7f2d1f8`, `74133b3`)
- [x] Visually-hidden `<h1>` (page title) added to 9 slider galleries + blog.html + contacts.html (blog_post.html gets its H1 from blog_post.js). New `.cherga_sr_only` utility in theme.css.
- [x] Alt text populated on 108 previously-empty images (98 gallery photos, contextual per gallery; + about tiles/featured thumbs, sidebar banners, contacts photo).
- [x] Structured-data graph: index.html `@graph` = Person(`@id` #person) + WebSite(#website) + ProfilePage; about.html Person unified via @id; blog.html Blog JSON-LD; **22 portfolio pages** each got BreadcrumbList + author `@id`->#person. All JSON-LD validated.
- [x] `/llms.txt` (AI answer-engine surface: bio, galleries, socials).
- [x] Plain-text bio: already satisfied — homepage + about.html carry extensive crawlable prose (not JS-only).
- [x] (P3) Cross-page naming consistency — DONE (commit pending): coherent system = **Portfolio** (nav/URL/hub `<title>` now "Photography Portfolio"; was "Photo Galleries") contains **Collections** (hub H1 "My Photography Collections" + about H2 "Explore My Collections", already consistent). Full tile↔H1 audit fixed 6 drifts: hub tiles Neowise→"Comet NEOWISE", Vera Su→"Vera Su Shipwreck", Birds→"Birds & Wildlife", Unsorted→"Various" (labels + alt); funfair H1s "Varna Funfair Summer/Winter"→"Funfair Summer/Winter" to match title/breadcrumb/JSON-LD/tile. All other tiles already matched their H1s.

## ✅ PHASE 3 — Performance / Core Web Vitals — DONE within Free-plan scope (commit `c9c0f43`)
- [x] Fonts: `preconnect` (fonts.googleapis.com + fonts.gstatic.com) + `&display=swap` on all 27 pages — removes render-blocking wait / FOIT.
- [x] Images (investigated, left as-is): lossless `jpegtran` pass = only **~1%** (images already 2048px, well-encoded sRGB, minimal metadata) → reverted (not worth binary-history churn). Meaningful savings need **lossy** re-encode (declined — fine-art quality) or **Cloudflare Polish** (Pro-plan; site is on **Free**, staying Free). Effectively optimal for the constraints.
- [~] Lazy-loading — DEFERRED: gallery grids are isotope masonry with `height:auto` images; native `loading="lazy"` breaks below-fold layout. Would need a lazy lib + isotope relayout-on-load shim. Revisit only if desired.
- [~] Dedicated OG card — DEFERRED (low value): gallery pages already use their own photo as `og:image` (good for social); only home/about/blog/contacts would benefit from a generic 1200×630 card. Minor.

## ✅ PHASE 4 — Content investment — DONE (commits `b992bb8`, `a1eef87`)
User edited `DRAFT_COPY_PHASE4.md`; copy cleaned + wired in. **Design decided with user via live mockups:** slider galleries → **sticky-reveal caption overlaid on the fullscreen slider** (scrolls up to reveal the frame; pure CSS `position:sticky`, overflow-fix scoped via `html.cherga_slider_reveal`); grid galleries → **full intro over the hero image + legibility scrim**. All in shared `css/gallery-intro.css`.
- [x] **Intro paragraph per gallery** — all **17** galleries (9 sliders + 8 grids), location keywords gold-highlighted. Applied via verified script handling every structural variant (kenburns vs slider_gallery; with-tagline vs h1-only heroes). Sliders' redundant `sr_only` H1 replaced by the visible caption H1.
- [x] **Real blog posts** — `2026-06-20-milky-way-from-bulgaria` (blog_standard) + `2026-07-12-chasing-comet-neowise` (blog_image). Removed `2022-01-22-first-post` stub + index.json entry; About Featured-Posts widget re-pointed to the Milky Way post. Blog listing/sidebar are dynamic (auto-update).
- [x] **About E-E-A-T** — new Background block (six years active, Varna/Black Sea, focus genres, full Sony gear list, availability). *(No exhibitions/awards/publications yet — user has none; byline photo `img/clipart/about_me.jpg` retained.)*
- [x] contacts.html "ABOUT ME" — tightened to a fine-art, contact-focused intro.

## ⏭️ PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST — 2026-07-26 (postponed +48h) `[!]`
- [ ] Canonical domain: 301 pages.dev + www → `https://ivaylodj.com` (schema/canonicals already non-www). Force HTTPS. Cloudflare Pages custom-domain + redirect rules.
- [ ] Refresh sitemap `lastmod` to launch date; re-verify every `<loc>` resolves on live host (incl. trailing-slash + `%20` image paths).
- [ ] Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster: verify domain, submit sitemap. Enable Cloudflare **IndexNow**.
- [x] Real branded **404 page** — `404.html` (dark/gold theme, noindex, absolute paths); Cloudflare Pages auto-serves it (commit `2fe5b67`).
- [ ] Confirm GTM (`GTM-WR3X354K`) published + Cloudflare Analytics fire on prod. Validate structured data (Rich Results Test) + OG (FB/Twitter validators) on live domain.
- [x] Deploy exclusions verified: `node_modules/` + `coverage/` not tracked (not deployed); `_templates/` is tracked but `robots.txt` disallows it (acceptable; optional to remove from repo later).

---

## Deferred / separate (with rationale)
- **blog_post.js double `index.json` fetch** — deliberately NOT consolidated: two timing-independent XHR entry points (loadPost L159 + sidebar builder L~856); refactoring the site's most fragile file for a browser-cached ~2KB non-bug is a poor risk/reward trade.
- **Blog comments** — fully planned in `COMMENTS_PLAN.md`; blocked on user's ~20-min Supabase Phase-0 (create project + Google OAuth, hand back Project URL + anon key, confirm moderation posture).
- **theme.js remaining hygiene** — none outstanding (setTimeout sweep + nested-toggle done in Phase 1).

## How to resume

**EXACT STATE — 2026-07-22 session.** Branch `main`, clean, pushed. HEAD = `da21437` (+ this doc commit).
Phases **1, 2, 3, 4 DONE**, incl. P3 naming consistency. Server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 52 tests pass.
`DRAFT_COPY_PHASE4.md` deleted (all its copy is now live).
**Launch postponed +48h → 2026-07-26:** `csoon_ivaylodj` countdown updated to 2026-07-26 23:59:59 (`endtimeDate: 26` in its `index.html`). Earlier: +48h → 2026-07-24 (commit `6a6d4dd`).

**We are HERE → all content phases done; only the launch-day dashboard tasks remain.**
1. **Pre-launch dashboard tasks (user-only, for 07-24)** — still open in the checklist above: canonical-domain 301s (pages.dev+www→ivaylodj.com), refresh sitemap `lastmod`, GSC + Bing verify + submit sitemap + IndexNow, confirm GTM published + analytics on prod, validate structured data/OG on live domain. *(Offered: I can draft step-by-step instructions for these.)*
2. **Blog comments** — separate, parked on user's Supabase Phase-0 (`COMMENTS_PLAN.md`).
3. **Optional polish (P3, deferred):** cross-page "Portfolio" naming consistency (nav / "Photo Galleries" / "My Photography Collections" / "Explore My Collections"); funfair label drift.

**Workflow reminder:** verify against disk (grep), `npm test` (52), serve-check on :8000, commit per logical unit (no AI attribution), verify push (local==origin). `DRAFT_COPY_PHASE4.md` is a temp working doc — delete it once its copy is live.
